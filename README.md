## About

Feather Engine is a lightweight 2D game engine with an entity-component-system (ECS) architecture. 
It was born out of my frustration with existing game engines. I wanted to make something with ZERO bloat, so I did.

## Compilation
Compile using the makefile - you'll need sdl2, sdl2_image and sdl2_ttf.
